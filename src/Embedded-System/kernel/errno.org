 EBADMSG (since Linux 3.7)
              Module signature is misformatted.

       EBUSY  Timeout while trying to resolve a symbol reference by this
              module.

       EFAULT An address argument referred to a location that is outside the
              process's accessible address space.

       ENOKEY (since Linux 3.7)
              Module signature is invalid or the kernel does not have a key
              for this module.  This error is returned only if the kernel
              was configured with CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE; if the kernel was
              not configured with this option, then an invalid or unsigned
              module simply taints the kernel.

       ENOMEM Out of memory.

       EPERM  The caller was not privileged (did not have the CAP_SYS_MODULE
              capability), or module loading is disabled (see
              /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled in proc(5)).

       The following errors may additionally occur for init_module():

       EEXIST A module with this name is already loaded.

       EINVAL param_values is invalid, or some part of the ELF image in
              module_image contains inconsistencies.

       ENOEXEC
              The binary image supplied in module_image is not an ELF image,
              or is an ELF image that is invalid or for a different
              architecture.

       The following errors may additionally occur for finit_module():

       EBADF  The file referred to by fd is not opened for reading.

       EFBIG  The file referred to by fd is too large.

       EINVAL flags is invalid.

       ENOEXEC
              fd does not refer to an open file.
