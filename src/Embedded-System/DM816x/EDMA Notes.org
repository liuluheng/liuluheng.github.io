* Note from TI81XX EDMA Driver User Guide
** Introduction
The EDMA3 controller consists of two principal blocks:
+ EDMA3 channel controller (EDMA3CC)
+ EDMA3 transfer controller(s) (EDMA3TC

** How to reserve different EDMA3 resources (DMA channels, TCCs, PaRAM Sets) on ARM side 
The resource allocation in EDMA3 is based on *a pre-aligned static configuration*. 
*** DMA Channels
In the source file =arch\arm\mach-omap2\devices.c=, array
=ti816x_dma_rsv_chans[][2]= is used to reserve various DMA channels to
the shadow regions of all other masters other than ARM. 

#+begin_src c
static const s16 ti816x_dma_rsv_chans[][2] = {
	/* (offset, number) */
	{0, 4},
	{26, 6},
	{48, 4},
	{56, 8},
	{-1, -1}
};
#+end_src
The first entry means 4 channels from channel '0' i.e. channels '0-3'
will be reserved for usage of other masters (for eg. DSP).

*** TCCs (i.e Interrupt channels)
It is assumed that if a particular channel number x is reserved for a
particular master then the TCC x is also reserved for that same
master. All drivers and applications running on all masters must keep
this in mind and be programmed.
*** PaRAM Sets
In the source file =arch\arm\mach-omap2\devices.c=, array
=ti816x_dma_rsv_slots[][2]= is used to reserve various PARAM sets (slot)
to the shadow regions of all other masters other than ARM. 

#+begin_src c
static const s16 ti816x_dma_rsv_slots[][2] = {
	/* (offset, number) */
	{0, 4},
	{26, 6},
	{48, 4},
	{56, 8},
	{64, 127},
	{-1, -1}
};
#+end_src
The first entry means 4 slots from slot '0' i.e. slots '0-3' will be
reserved for usage of other masters (for eg. DSP).

 *Note 1:* DMA channels and PaRAM Sets are one-to-one mapped, meaning
thereby DMA channel X can ONLY use PaRAM Set X for its working. 

 *Note 2:* A DMA/QDMA channel also require a TCC for correct functioning.
By default, DMA channels and TCCs are one-to-one mapped, meaning
thereby DMA channel Y can ONLY use TCC Y for its working. (No such
constraint is there for QDMA channels.) 

** How to change various other global settings
*** How to change default event queue (or Transfer Controller, TC) priorities?
Array =ti816x_queue_priority_mapping[][2]= can be used to change the
default event queue priorities. This array is an array of structures
having the first structure member as the event queue number and the
second structure member as the priority. '0' is the highest priority,
'1' is the second highest and so on. 

#+begin_src c
static const s8 ti816x_queue_priority_mapping[][2] = {
        /* {event queue no, Priority} */
        {0, 0},
        {1, 1},
        {2, 2},
        {3, 3},
        {-1, -1}
};
#+end_src

* Note from Programming the EDMA3 using the Low-Level Driver (LLD)
** Abstract
It consists of three (3) libraries:

1. EDMA3 Resource Manager (RM library)
2. EDMA3 Driver (DRV library)
3. Chip-specific configuration files (Sample library)

** Brief Overview of EDMA3
DMA transfers can be triggered 3 different ways: (1) a manual START;
(2) via a sync event from a peripheral; (3) via a chained event - i.e.
the completion of channel x can kick off channel y to start.

A basic transfer requires the source address, destination address and
a count value (how much to copy). Source and destination addresses are
fairly obvious. The count value, however, is three-dimensional - ACNT,
BCNT and CCNT. 
+ ACNT specifies the number of bytes in an "element". For
  example, for 16-bit audio data, ACNT would be 2 bytes. This is the
  "minimum" transfer size. 
+ BCNT specifies the number of "elements" in a
  "frame" or "line".
+ CCNT specifies the "block" size or the number of
  frames in the block. Each of these count values max out at 64K. So,
  the max transfer is 64K*64K*64K. 

For more advanced transfers, the EDMA offers *indexing* between
transfers for both the source and destination addresses. For example,
if you'd like to bump the src address 4 bytes after each element
transfer, you can set 'BIDX to 4. After the EDMA transfers the first
element, the src address will be indexed 4 bytes (plus or minus) prior
to the next transfer. The destination address has similar indexing
capabilities. Also, 'CIDX can be employed to bump the src or dst
addresses after a "frame" or "line" is transfered. A combination of
these indexes can automatically perform "channel sorting" on incoming
or outgoing data "free of charge" - with no time penalty.

The EDMA3 also allows for "*linking*" and "chaining" capabilities.
Linking is the process of "*reloading*" a channel's peripheral
configuration registers (or buffer descriptor) with another set after
the first transfer is done. For example, when channel X is complete,
maybe you'd like to transfer the same thing again. Extra "Reload"
parameter sets are available to hold another configuration that can be
"reloaded" automatically into Channel X's registers upon completion of
a transfer. This does NOT start a transfer - it only configures the
channel for the next transfer. "Chaining" is the ability for one
channel's completion to trigger another transfer. For example, if
channel X is chained to channel Y, when channel X completes, it
triggers channel Y to start transferring.

** 5.7 Setting Up a Transfer
*** Initiating a DMA/QDMA channel
 (a) Determine the *type* of channel (QDMA or DMA) to be used.

 (b) Channel mapping

   (i) If using a QDMA channel, program the =DQCHMAP= with the parameter
   set number to which the channel maps and the trigger word.

   (ii) If using a DMA channel, program the =DCHMAP= with the parameter set number to which the
   channel maps.

(c) If the channel is being used in the context of a shadow region, ensure the =DRAE/DRAEH= for the
region is properly set up to allow read write accesses to bits in the event registers and interrupt
registers in the Shadow region memory map. The subsequent steps in this process should be done
using the respective shadow region registers.

(d) Determine the *type of triggering* used.

(i) If external events are used for triggering (DMA channels), enable
the respective event in =EER/EERH= by writing into =EESR/EESRH=.

(ii) If QDMA Channel is used, enable the channel in =QEER= by writing into =QEESR=.

  (e) Queue setup
   
  (i) If a QDMA channel is used, set up the =QDMAQNUM= to map the
   channel to the respective event queue.
  
  (ii) If a DMA channel is used, set up the =DMAQNUM= to map the event to the respective eventqueue.
*** Parameter set setup
(a) Program the =PaRAM set= number associated with the channel. Note that if it is a QDMA channel,
the PaRAM entry that is configured as trigger word is written to last. Alternatively, enable the
QDMA channel (step 1-b-ii above) just before the write to the trigger word.
See Section 5.3 for parameter set field setups for different types of
transfers. See the sections on chaining  and interrupt completion on
how to set up final/intermediate completion chaining and/or interrupts.
*** Interrupt setup
(a) Enable the interrupt in the =IER/IERH= by writing into =IESR/IESRH=.

(b) Ensure that the =EDMA3CC= completion interrupt (either the global or
the shadow region interrupt) is enabled properly in the device
interrupt controller.

(c) Ensure the =EDMA3CC= completion interrupt (this refers to either the
Global interrupt or the shadow region interrupt) is enabled properly
in the Device Interrupt controller.

(d) Set up the interrupt controller properly to receive the expected
EDMA3 interrupt.

*** Initiate transfer
(a) This step is highly dependent on the event trigger source:

(i) If the source is an external event coming from a peripheral, the peripheral will be enabled to
start generating relevant EDMA3 events that can be latched to the ER
transfer.

(ii) For QDMA events, writes to the trigger word (step 2-a above) will
initiate the transfer.

(iii) Manually triggered transfers will be initiated by writes to the
Event Set Registers (ESR/ESRH).

(iv) Chained-trigger events initiate when a previous transfer returns
a transfer completion code equal to the chained channel number.

*** Wait for completion
(a) If the interrupts are enabled as mentioned in step 3 above, then
the EDMA3CC will generate a completion interrupt to the CPU whenever
transfer completion results in setting the corresponding bits in the
interrupt pending register (IPR/IPRH). The set bits must be cleared in
the =IPR\IPRH= by writing to corresponding bit in =ICR\ICRH=.

(b) If polling for completion (interrupts not enabled in the device
controller), then the application code can wait on the expected bits
to be set in the =IPR\IPRH=. Again, the set bits in the =IPR\IPRH= must be
manually cleared via =ICR\ICRH= before the next set of transfers is
performed for the same transfer completion code values.
