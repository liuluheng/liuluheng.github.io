* Set Up SSH Keys
** Create the RSA key pair on the client machine
#+begin_src sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
#+end_src

** Copy the Public Key
#+begin_src sh
#1 use ssh-copy-id command
ssh-copy-id user@123.45.56.78
#2 use SSH
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@123.45.56.78 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
#+end_src

** [Optional] Disable the Password for Root Login
#+begin_src sh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#fine the line that includes PermitRootLogin and modify it
PermitRootLogin without-password
reload ssh
#+end_src

* Setting up a new user[fn:1]
** Create a New User
#+begin_src sh
adduser demo
#+end_src
** add Root Privileges to the New User
#+begin_src sh
visudo

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#Under there, add the following line, granting all the permissions to your new user
demo    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#+end_src
** Configure SSH (OPTIONAL)
#+begin_src sh
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Port 25000
Protocol 2
PermitRootLogin no
#+end_src
*PermitRootLogin*: change this from yes to no to stop future root login.
You will now only be logging on as the new user.


Add these lines to the bottom of the document, replacing *demo* in the
AllowUsers line with your username. (AllowUsers will limit login to
only the users on that line. To avoid this, skip this line):
#+begin_src sh
UseDNS no
AllowUsers demo
#+end_src
** Reload and Done
#+begin_src sh

* How To Add Swap on Ubuntu 12.04[fn:4]
** Check for Swap Space
#+begin_src sh
sudo swapon -s
#An empty list will confirm that you have no swap files enabled:
Filename				Type		Size	Used	Priority
#+end_src
** Create and Enable the Swap File
1024*512k=512M swap space
#+begin_src sh
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=512k
sudo mkswap /swapfile
#The results display:
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 262140 KiB
no label, UUID=103c4545-5fc5-47f3-a8b3-dfbdb64fd7eb
#Finish up by activating the swap file:
sudo swapon /swapfile
#You will then be able to see the new swap file when you view the swap summary.
swapon -s
Filename				Type		Size	Used	Priority
/swapfile                               file		262140	0	-1
#the swap is permanent by adding it to the fstab file
sudo nano /etc/fstab
#Paste in the following line:
 /swapfile       none    swap    sw      0       0 
#+end_src

** More Setting
Swappiness in the file should be set to 0. Skipping this step may
cause both poor performance, whereas setting it to 0 will cause swap
to act as an emergency buffer, preventing out-of-memory crashes.

You can do this with the following commands:
#+begin_src sh
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
echo vm.swappiness = 0 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
#+end_src

To prevent the file from being world-readable, set up the correct
permissions on the swap file:
#+begin_src sh
sudo chown root:root /swapfile 
sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile
#+end_src
* How To Install Linux, nginx, MySQL, PHP (LEMP) stack on Ubuntu 12.04[fn:5]
** Update Apt-Get
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get update
#+end_src
** Install MySQL
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
#+end_src

*** configuration
Once you have installed MySQL, we should activate it with this
command:
#+begin_src sh
sudo mysql_install_db
#+end_src

Finish up by running the MySQL set up script:
#+begin_src sh
sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
#+end_src

It’s easiest just to say Yes to all the options. At the end, MySQL
will reload and implement the new changes.
#+begin_src sh
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y                                            
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
... Success!

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

** Install nginx
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install nginx
#+end_src

start nginx
#+begin_src sh
sudo service nginx start
#+end_src

You can confirm that nginx has installed an your web server by
directing your browser to your IP address. You can run the following
command to reveal your VPS's IP address.
#+begin_src sh
ifconfig eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2 }'
#+end_src
** Install PHP
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install php5-fpm
sudo apt-get install php5-mysql php5-gd php5-xdebug php-apc
#+end_src
php5-gd: This package provides a module for handling graphics directly
from PHP scripts. It supports the PNG, JPEG, XPM formats as well as
Freetype/ttf fonts.

More:

** Configure php
#+begin_src sh
sudo nano /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini
cgi.fix_pathinfo=0
#+end_src
Find the line, cgi.fix_pathinfo=1, and change the 1 to 0.

If this number is kept as 1, the php interpreter will do its best to
process the file that is as near to the requested file as possible.
This is a possible security risk. If this number is set to 0,
conversely, the interpreter will only process the exact file path—a
much safer alternative.

We need to make another small change in the php5-fpm configuration.
#+begin_src sh
sudo nano /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock
sudo service php5-fpm restart
#+end_src
** Configure nginx

** Basic NGINX Optimization
Increase or decrease the number of workers depending on your system's
specs:
#+begin_src sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
worker_processes 1;
#NGINX limits the number of connections that a worker can maintain at one time, if your websites have many visitors you might want to increase the limit of connections
worker_connections 768;
#Enabling Gzip
gzip on;
gzip_types text/css text/x-component application/x-javascript application/javascript text/javascript text/x-js text/richtext image/svg+xml text/plain text/xsd text/xsl text/xml image/x-icon;
#+end_src
Files can be compressed using Gzip to accelerate WordPress, the
smaller the data size requested by the user, the faster the response.
Think about CSS files & HTML files, they have many similar strings,
repeated text and white spaces.
** Creating NGINX .conf files
create 3 files that will hold our configurations:

+ common.conf: Configurations applicable to all sites.
+ wordpress.conf: Configurations applicable to all WordPress sites.
+ multisite.conf: Special configurations for WordPress multisite with
  sub-directories.
*** create the dir
#+begin_src sh
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/global
cd /etc/nginx/global
#+end_src
*** common.conf file
#+begin_src sh
sudo nano common.conf

# Global configuration file.
# ESSENTIAL : Configure Nginx Listening Port
listen 80;
# ESSENTIAL : Default file to serve. If the first file isn't found, 
index index.php index.html index.htm;
# ESSENTIAL : no favicon logs

    access_log off;
}
# ESSENTIAL : robots.txt
location = /robots.txt {
    allow all;
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
}
# ESSENTIAL : Configure 404 Pages

    access_log off; log_not_found off; expires 30d;
}
#+end_src

=location = /robots.txt {allow all;}= allows the access to robots.txt,
if you want to specify another directory for the robots.txt you can
add an alias:

#+begin_src sh
location /robots.txt {
    alias /var/www/example.com/public/sample_robots.txt;
}
#+end_src
=location ~ /\. {deny all;}= in the Linux operating system a hidden
file begins with a ".", access to some hidden files, such as
=.htaccess=, should be blocked for security reasons.


=location ~* ^.+\.(js|css|swf...= expires headers tell the browser
whether they should request a specific file from the server or whether
they should grab it from the browser's cache. With expires 30d we are
telling the browser to store static files such as pictures for 30
days.

*** wordpress.conf file
#+begin_src sh

=location ~* /(?:uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {deny all;}= this will
prevent malicious code from being uploaded and executed from the
WordPress media directory.

=location ~ \.php$ {...}= since WordPress is a php site, we need to
tell NGINX how to a pass our php scripts to PHP5.

=try_files $uri =404;= this is a security rule, you only want to
either serve a determined php file or go to a 404 error.

*** multisite.conf file
#+begin_src sh

* How To Create a SSL Certificate on nginx for Ubuntu 12.04
** Create a Directory for the Certificate
The SSL certificate has 2 parts main parts: the certificate itself and
the public key.
#+begin_src sh
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
cd /etc/nginx/ssl
#+end_src
** Create the Server Key and Certificate Signing Request
Start by creating the private server key. During this process, you
will be asked to enter a specific passphrase. Be sure to note this
phrase carefully, if you forget it or lose it, you will not be able to
access the certificate.
#+begin_src sh
sudo openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
#Follow up by creating a certificate signing request:
sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
#+end_src
This command will prompt terminal to display a lists of fields that need to be filled in.

The most important line is "Common Name". Enter your official domain
name here or, if you don't have one yet, your site's IP address. Leave
the challenge password and optional company name blank.
** Remove the Passphrase
 However, it would serve us to remove the passphrase. Although having
 the passphrase in place does provide heightened security, the issue
 starts when one tries to reload nginx. In the event that nginx
 crashes or needs to reboot, you will always have to re-enter your
 passphrase to get your entire web server back online.
#+begin_src sh
sudo cp server.key server.key.org
sudo openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
#+end_src
** Sign your SSL Certificate
Keep in mind that you can specify how long the certificate should
remain valid by changing the 365 to the number of days you prefer. As
it stands this certificate will expire after one year.
#+begin_src sh
sudo openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
#+end_src
** Set Up the Certificate for Test [option]
