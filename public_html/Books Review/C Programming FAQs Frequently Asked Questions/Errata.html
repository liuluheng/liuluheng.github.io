</p>

<p>
-&#x2014;        &#x2013;&#x2014;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
front cover        The ladder has no rungs.
</p>

<p>
xxix                "woundn't" should be "wouldn't"
</p>

<p>
2        1.1        The fourth bulleted guarantee (about the sizes
                following the "obvious progression") is
                improperly stated.  What the C Standard actually
                talks about, as in the rest of this answer, is
                just the ranges of the standard types, not their
                sizes in bits.  So the real guarantees (as
                summarized below) are that
</p>

<p>
sizeof(char)  is at least 8 bits
sizeof(short) is at least 16 bits
sizeof(int)   is at least 16 bits
sizeof(long)  is at least 32 bits
</p>

<p>
and, in C99,
</p>

<p>
sizeof(long long) is at least 64 bits
</p>

<p>
3-4        1.3        In C99, the new &lt;inttypes.h&gt; header provides
                Standard names for exact-size types: int16<sub>t</sub>,
                uint32<sub>t</sub>, etc.
</p>

<p>
4        1.4        In C99, long long is defined as an integer type
                with, in effect, at least 64 bits.
</p>

<p>
6        1.7        There may be zero definitions of an external
                function or variable that is not referenced
                in any expression.
                [Thanks and $1 to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
7        1.7        "use include to bring" should be
                "use #include to bring"
</p>

<p>
11        1.14        In the second fix, at the bottom of the page,
                it could conceivably be necessary to precede
                the line
</p>

<p>
typedef struct node *NODEPTR;
</p>

<p>
with the line
</p>

<p>
struct node;
</p>

<p>
for the reason mentioned on page 13, although
in that case one of the two other fixes would
clearly be preferable.
[Thanks to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
13        1.15        In the alternate fix, at the bottom of the page,
                it could conceivably be necessary to precede
                the typedef declarations with the lines
</p>

<p>
struct a;
struct b;
</p>

<p>
although again, putting those typedefs after the
complete structure definitions would clearly be
preferable in that case.
[Thanks to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
18        1.22        The odd "return 0;" line is not really necessary.
</p>

<p>
20        1.24        Another possible arrangement is
</p>

<p>
<i>* file1.h *</i>
#define ARRAYSZ 3
extern int array[ARRAYSZ];
</p>

<p>
<i>* file1.c *</i>
#include "file1.h"
int array[ARRAYSZ];
</p>

<p>
/* file2.c"
#include "file1.h"
</p>

<p>
[Thanks to Jon Jagger]
</p>

<p>
23        1.29        [2nd bullet] "everything else termed" should be
                "everything else, termed"
</p>

<p>
24        1.29        [Rule 3] "if the header" should be "if any header".
                [Thanks and $1 to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
24        1.29        [Rule 4] "(i.e., function names)" should be
                "(e.g., function names)".
                [Thanks and $1 to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
24        1.29        The text at the bottom of the page suggests that
                "future directions" name patterns such as str[a-z]*
                are reserved only if their corresponding headers
                (e.g. &lt;stdlib.h&gt;) are included.  The reserved
                function names are unconditionally reserved;
                it is only the macro names that are reserved only
                if the header is included.
                [Thanks and $1 to Mark Brader]
</p>

<p>
25        1.29        "if you don't include the header files" should be
                "if you don't include any header files".
</p>

<p>
32        2.4        Besides -&gt; and sizeof, the . operator, as well as
                declarations of actual structures, also require
                the compiler to know more about the structure and
                so preclude incomplete or hidden definitions.
                [Thanks to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
33-36        2.6        In C99, a structure can contain a variable-length
                array (VLA) as its last member, providing a
                well-defined, Standard-compliant alternative.
</p>

<p>
38        2.10        C99 <b>does</b> have a way of generating anonymous
                structure values: "compound literals".
</p>

<p>
40        2.12        When trying to minimize wasted space in structures,
                array members should be ordered based on the size
                of their primitive types, not their overall size.
                [Thanks and $1 to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
43        2.20        "ANSI/SIO" should be "ANSI/ISO"
</p>

<p>
In C99, the "designated initializer" mechanism
allows any member of a union to be initialized.
</p>

<p>
50        3.3        Of course, another way to increment i is i += 1.
                [Thanks to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
51        3.4        "higher precedence than *):" should be
                "higher precedence than *:"
</p>

<p>
52        3.6        Delete the close parenthesis at the end of the answer.
</p>

<p>
57        3.12        In C++, the prefix form ++i is preferred.
                [Thanks to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
68        4.5        The reference to ANSI Sec. 3.3.4 should say
                "esp. footnote 44".
                [Thanks to Willis Gooch]
</p>

<p>
72-3        4.10        In C99, it is possible to use a "compound
                literal" to generate a pointer to an (unnamed)
                constant value.
</p>

<p>
73        4.11        The reference to K&amp;R2 sec. 5.2 should be pp. 95-7.
                [Thanks and $1 to Nikos Triantafillis]
</p>

<p>
75        4.13        "can interconverted" should be "can be interconverted".
                [Thanks and $1 to Howard Ham]
</p>

<p>
84        5.8        Either the comma or the parentheses in the answer
                should be changed.
</p>

<p>
95        6.2        The typography in the following line is inconsistent
                for the "x" of "x<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>".
</p>

<p>
104-5        6.15        C99 introduces variable-length arrays (VLA's) which,
                among other things, <b>do</b> allow declaration of a
                local array of size matching a passed-in array.
</p>

<p>
105-7        6.16        In C99, another solution is to use a
                variable-length array.
</p>

<p>
110        6.19        C99's variable-length arrays are also a nice
                solution to this problem.
</p>

<p>
115        7.1        The close parenthesis and period ")." at the bottom
                of the page are not part of the #define line.
</p>

<p>
121        7.9        There is an extra semicolon at the end of the first
                line of mymalloc's definition.
                [Thanks and $1 to Todd Burruss]
</p>

<p>
126        7.10        Missing "it"; should be "even if it is not
                dereferenced".
                [Thanks and $1 to Clinton Sheppard]
</p>

<p>
132        7.30        It would be even safer to add a second test on
                nchmax:
</p>

<p>
if(nchread &gt;= nchmax) {
        nchmax += 20;
        if(nchread &gt;= nchmax) {
                free(retbuf);
                return NULL;
        }
        newbuf = realloc(retbuf, nchmax + 1);
</p>

<p>
The concern is that, while reading a <b>very</b> long line,
nchmax might overflow, wrapping back around to 0.
[Thanks to Mark Brader]
</p>

<p>
134        7.32        C99's variable-length arrays (VLA's) can be used
                to more cleanly accomplish most of the tasks
                which alloca used to be put to.
</p>

<p>
136        8.1        "Although string literal" should be
                "Although a string literal"
</p>

<p>
136        8.2        C can be tricked into seeming to assign an array

168        11.1        The story has gotten longer: A new revision of
                the C Standard, "C99", has been ratified,
                superseding the original ANSI C Standard.
                This Errata list has been updated to note those
                answers in the book which have become dated due
                to C99 changes.
</p>

<p>
169-70        11.2        C99 <b>is</b> available in electronic form, for $18
                from www.ansi.org .
</p>

<p>
174        11.10        As written, the "complicated series of assignments"
                of course includes some declarations and initializations.
                [Thanks to James Stern]
</p>

<p>
175        11.10        "e.g., (const char) <b>* in this case" should be
                "e.g., (const char *</b>) in this case"
</p>

"when the pointers which" should either be
"when the pointers" or "with pointers which"

180        11.19        "questions 20.20" should be "question 20.20"

</p>

<p>
183-4        11.27        In C99, external identifiers are required
                to be unique in the first 32 characters;
                C90's extremely Spartan limitation to six
                characters has been relaxed.
</p>

<p>
186        11.29        You may also need to rework calls to realloc
                that use NULL or 0 as first or second arguments
                (see question 7.30).
</p>

<p>
186        11.29        You may also need to rework conditional compilation
                involving #elif.

                (see question 11.2).

198        12.11        A semicolon is missing after "int i = 0".
</p>

<p>
The } just before the line "*p = '\0'" is
indented one tab too few.
</p>

<p>
Two instances of "*&#x2013;p" have the minus signs merged
so as to appear as one.
</p>

<p>
201        12.16        [case 2] The variable line is not declared;
                it should probably be a char [], suitably
                initialized, e.g.:
</p>

<p>
char line[] = "1 2.3 4.5e6 789e10";
</p>

207-8        12.21        The technique of writing to a file may give the

</p>

<p>
The "hope that a future revision of the ANSI/ISO
C Standard will include" the snprintf function
has been fulfilled: C99 does specify it.
As a bonus, the C99 snprintf can be used to predict
the size required for an arbitrary sprintf call,
too &#x2013; it can be called with a null pointer
instead of a destination buffer (and 0 as the
size of that nonexistent buffer) and it returns
the number of characters it would have written.
</p>

<p>
212        12.28        The answer is in the wrong font.
</p>

<p>
213        12.30        Updating (overwriting) a text file in-place is
                not fully portable; the C Standard leaves it
                implementation-defined whether a write to a
                text file truncates it at that point.

<p>
224        13.4        "upper- or lowercase" should probably be
                "upper or lower case".

<p>
225        13.6        Since the fragment calls printf, it must

</p>

<p>
227        13.6        Also, since the input string is modified,
                it must be writable; see question 1.32.
</p>

<p>
234        13.14        "time<sub>ts</sub>" should perhaps be "time<sub>t's</sub>"
</p>

<p>
240        13.17        The code
</p>

<p>
srand((unsigned int)time((time<sub>t</sub> *)NULL));
</p>

<p>
though popular and generally effective is, alas,
not strictly conforming.  It's theoretically
possible that time<sub>t</sub> could be defined as a
floating-point type under some implementation,
and that the time<sub>t</sub> values returned by time()
could therefore exceed the range of an unsigned
int in such a way that a well-defined cast to
(unsigned int) is not possible.
</p>

<p>
242-3        13.20        The attributions listed for methods 2 and 3 are
                scrambled.  Method 2 is the one described in
                the 1958 Box and Muller paper (as well as by
                Abramowitz and Stegun, apparently).  Method 3
                is originally due to Marsaglia.
</p>

<p>
244        13.21        If you're not familiar with the notation [0, 1),
                it means that drand48() returns a number x
                such that 0 &lt;= x and x &lt; 1.
</p>

<p>
250        14.5        The suggested expression should read
</p>

<p>
fabs(a - b) &lt;= epsilon * fabs(a)
</p>

<p>
It performs poorly if a == 0.0 (which is another
argument in favor of "mak[ing] the threshold
a function of b, or of both a and b").
</p>

<p>
253        14.8        Of course, you can always compute pi using
                4*atan(1.0) or acos(-1.0).

<p>
253        14.9        C99 specifies isnan() and several other
                classification routines.

<p>
254-5        14.11        C99 supports complex as a standard type.

<p>
260-1        15.4        The first argument to vstrcat() could be const char *,

264        15.5        The fmt argument to error() could be const char *.

<p>
269-71        15.12        The fmt arguments to faterror(), verror(), and
                error() could all be const char *.
</p>

<p>
274        16.4        [point 2] The problem could be caused by a setbuf
                or setvbuf buffer local to any function.

276        16.7        Variable "s" isn't declared.  It's pretty obvious
                what it should be, but to make it explicit, change
                the struct declaration to

342-44        20.13        The tone of this question's answer can be read as
                suggesting that efficiency isn't important at all.
                That's not the case, of course &#x2013; efficiency can
                very important, and poorly-written programs can
                run abysmally inefficiently.
</p>

<p>
The point is that there are good ways and bad
ways of achieving an appropriate level of
performance for a given program, and that (for
example) picking a good algorithm tends to make a
much bigger difference than does microoptimizing
the coding details of a lesser algorithm.
