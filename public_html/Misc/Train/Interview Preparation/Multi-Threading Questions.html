<h3 id="sec-1-1">heavyweight vs lightweight</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Processes are always used to execute "heavyweight" jobs such as
running different applications, while threads are always used to
execute smaller "lightweight" jobs such as auto saving.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">create</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
New threads are easily created, whereas new processes require
duplication of the parent process.
</p>

<p>
Creating a new process can be expensive. It takes time. (A call into
the operating system is needed, and if the process creation triggers
process rescheduling activity, the operating system's
context-switching mechanism will become involved.) IT takes memory.
(The entire process must be replicated.) 
</p>

<p>
Threads can be created without replicating an entire process.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Sharing Resources</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Independent processes share nothing. Each process runs in a separate
address space. Changes made to the parent processes donot affect the
child processes.
</p>

<p>
Threads share such process resources and global variables and file
descriptions.  If one thread
changes the value of any such resource, the change will be evident to
any other thread in the process, if anyone cares to look. The sharing
of process resources among threads is one of the multithreaded
programming model's major performance advantages, as well as one of
its most difficult programming aspects. Having all of this context
available to all threads in the same memory facilitates communication
between threads. However, at the same time, it makes it easy to
introduce errors of the sort in which one thread affects the value of
a variable used by another thread in ways the other thread did not
expect.
</p>

<p>
Then switching between threads is much simpler and faster then
switching between processes.
</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4">Communication</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Threads can directly communicate with other threads of its process;
processes must use inter-process communication mechanisms to
communicate with sibling processes.
</p>

<p>
Multiple processes can use any of the many other UNIX Interprocess
Communication (IPC) mechanisms: sockets, shared memory, and messages,
to name a few. The multiprocess version of our program uses shared
memory, but the other methods are equally valid. Even the waitpid call
in our program could be used to exchange information, if the program
checked its return value. However, in the multiprocess world, all
types of IPC involve a call into the operating system—to initialize
shared memory or a message structure, for instance. This makes
communication between processes more expensive than communication
between threads. Add to this the cost of
interprocess communication and synchronization of shared data, which
also may involve calls into the operating system kernel.
</p>

<p>
When processes
synchronize, they usually have to issue system calls, a relatively
expensive operation that involves trapping into the kernel. But
threads can synchronize by simply monitoring a variable—in other
words, staying within the user address space of the program.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">similarities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
A thread can do anything that a process can do. They are both able to
reproduce(Processes create child process and threads create more
threads.), and they both have ID, priority and etc.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">primary benefits to multithreading</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-process-and-a-thread">http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-process-and-a-thread</a>
</p>

<p>
There are four primary benefits to multithreading:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming abstraction. Dividing up work and assigning each
division to a unit of execution (a thread) is a natural approach to
many problems. Programming patterns that utilize this approach
include the reactor, thread-per-connection, and thread pool
patterns. Some, however, view threads as an anti-pattern. The
inimitable Alan Cox summed this up well with the quote, "threads are
for people who can't program state machines."
</li>

<li>Parallelism. In machines with multiple processors, threads provide
an efficient way to achieve true parallelism. As each thread
receives its own virtualized processor and is an
independently-schedulable entity, multiple threads may run on
multiple processors at the same time, improving a system's
throughput. To the extent that threads are used to achieve
parallelism—that is, there are no more threads than processors—the
"threads are for people who can't program state machines" quote does
not apply.
</li>

<li>Blocking I/O. Without threads, blocking I/O halts the whole process.
This can be detrimental to both throughput and latency. In a
multithreaded process, individual threads may block, waiting on I/O,
while other threads make forward progress. Asynchronous &amp;
non-blocking I/O are alternative solutions to threads for this
issue.
</li>

<li>Memory savings. Threads provide an efficient way to share memory yet
utilize multiple units of execution. In this manner they are an
alternative to multiple processes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The cost of these benefits of threading are increased complexity in
the form of needing to manage concurrency through mechanisms such as
mutexes and condition variables. Given the growing trend toward
processors sporting multiple cores and systems sporting multiple
processors, threading is only going to become a more important tool in
system programming.
</p>


<p>
Advantages and Disadvantages
</p>

<p>
Thread Advantages
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Threads are memory efficient. Many threads can be efficiently contained within a single EXE, while each process can incur the overhead of an entire EXE.
</li>
<li>Threads share a common program space, which among other things, means that messages can be passed by queuing only a pointer to the message. Since processes do not share a common program space, the kernel must either copy the entire message from process A's program space to process B's program space - a tremendous disadvantage for large messages, or provide some mechanism by which process B can access the message.
</li>
<li>Thread task switching time is faster, since a thread has less context to save than a process.
</li>
<li>With threads the kernel is linked in with the user code to create a single EXE. This means that all the kernel data structures like the ready queue are available for viewing with a debugger. This is not the case with a process, since the process is an autonomous application and the kernel is separate, which makes for a less flexible environment.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thread Disadvantages
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Threads are typically not loadable. That is, to add a new thread, you must add the new thread to the source code, then compile and link to create the new executable. Processes are loadable, thus allowing a multi-tasking system to be characterized dynamically. For example, depending upon system conditions, certain processes can be loaded and run to characterize the system. However, the same can be accomplished with threads by linking in all the possible threads required by the system, but only activating those that are needed, given the conditions. The really big advantage of loadability is that the process concept allows processes (applications) to be developed by different companies and offered as tools to be loaded and used by others in their multi-tasking applications.
</li>
<li>Threads can walk over the data space of other threads. This cannot
happen with processes. If an attempt is made to walk on another
process an exception error will occur.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sec-10">write thread code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
What can go wrong when you write thread code and how can you guard
against them?
</p>

<p>
Basically, the big three of threading problems are deadlock, races and
starvation. 
</p>

<p>
The simplest deadlock condition is when there are two threads and
thread A can't progress until thread B finishes, while thread B can't
progress until thread A finishes. This is usually because both need
the same two resources to progress, A has one and B has the other.
Various symmetry breaking algorithms can prevent this in the two
thread or larger circle cases. 
</p>

<p>
Races happen when one thread changes the state of some resource when
another thread is not expecting it (such as changing the contents of a
memory location when another thread is part way through reading, or
writing to that memory). Locking methods are the key here. (Some lock
free methods and containers are also good choices for this. As are
atomic operations, or transaction based operations.) 
</p>

<p>
Starvation happens when a thread needs a resource to proceed, but
can't get it. The resource is constantly tied up by other threads and
the one that needs it can't get in. The scheduling algorithm is the
problem when this happens. Look at algorithms that ass

<div id="outline-container-sec-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-11">What is the atomic operation and why do they matter?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
Atomic operations are operations that can't lose control of the
resources they have while executing. Functionally, they are equivalent
to operations that happen in a single clock tick on a simple
non-pipelined processor. In reality, most take more than a tick but
are protected while they execute. They are immune to race conditions,
and that makes them useful.

<div id="outline-container-sec-13" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-13">Explain how a thread pool works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
One thread dispatches other threads to do useful work which are
usually part of a worker thread pool. This thread pool is usually
pre-allocated before the boss(or master) begins dispatching threads to
work. Although threads are lightweight, they still incur overhead when
they are created.
</p>

<p>
If the boss thread becomes a worker thread once it's done starting
other worker threads then this is a Peer Thread Design Pattern.

<h2 id="sec-14">Define: critical section</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
critical section is a piece of code that accesses a shared resource
(data structure or device) that must not be concurrently accessed by
more than one thread of execution. A critical section will usually
terminate in fixed time, and a thread, task or process will have to
wait a fixed time to enter it (aka bounded waiting). Some
synchronization mechanism is required at the entry and exit of the
critical section to ensure exclusive use, for example a semaphore.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-15">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Recursive: allows a thread holding the lock to acquire the same lock
again which may be necessary for recursive algorithms.
</li>
<li>Queuing: allows for fairness in lock acquisition by providing FIFO
ordering to the arrival of lock requests. Such mutexes may be slower
due to increased overhead and the possibility of having to wake
threads next in line that may be sleeping.
</li>
<li>Reader/Writer: allows for multiple readers to acquire the lock
simultaneously. If existing readers have the lock, a writer request
on the lock will block until all readers have given up the lock.
This can lead to writer starvation.

For the Banker's algorithm to work, it needs to know three things:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How much of each resource each process could possibly request[CLAIMS]
</li>
<li>How much of each resource each process is currently holding[ALLOCATED]
</li>

maximum claim made by it.

<li>request ≤ available, else process waits until resources are

<p>
Let n be the number of processes in the system and m be the number of resource types. Then we need the following data structures:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Available: A vector of length m indicates the number of available
resources of each type. If Available[j] = k, there are k
instances of resource type Rj available.

<li>Max: An n×m matrix defines the maximum demand of each process.
If Max[i,j] = k, then Pi may request at most k instances of
resource type Rj.

<li>Allocation: An n×m matrix defines the number of resources of
each type currently allocated to each process. If Allocation[i,j]
= k, then process Pi is currently allocated k instances of
resource type Rj.

<li>Need: An n×m matrix indicates the remaining resource need of
each process. If Need[i,j] = k, then Pi may need k more instances

exists is an <b>unsafe</b> state.

static since in most systems the number of processes varies

all its resources (when the process terminates) is sufficient for
the correctness of the algorithm, however it is not sufficient for

Spinlocks are locks which spin on mutexes. Spinning refers to
continuously polling until a condition has been met. In the case of
spinlocks, if a thread cannot obtain the mutex, it will keep polling
the lock until it is free. The advantage of a spinlock is that the
thread is kept active and does not enter a sleep-wait for mutex to
become available, thus can perform better in certain cases than
typical blocking-sleep-wait style mutexes. Mutexes which are heavily
contended are poor candidates for spinlocks.

Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">Optimistic concurrency control(OCC)</a>. OCC assumes that multiple
transactions can frequently complete without interfering with each
other. While running, transactions use data resources without
acquiring locks on those resources. Before committing, each
transaction verifies that no other transaction has modified the data
it has read. If the check reveals conflicting modifications, the
committing transaction rolls back and can be restarted.

In Linux, for example, a system called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futex">Futex</a> (Short for Fast Userspace
Mutex) is used.
</p>

<p>
In this system an atomic increment and test operation is performed on
the mutex variable in user space.
</p>

<p>
If the result of the operation indicates that there was no contention
on the lock, the call to pthread<sub>mutex</sub><sub>lock</sub> returns without ever
context switching into the kernel, so the operation of taking a mutex
can be very fast.
</p>

<p>
Only if contention was detected does a system call (called futex) and
context switch into the kernel occurs that puts the calling process to
sleep until the mutex is released.

Fork : The fork call basically makes a duplicate of the current
process, identical in almost every way (not everything is copied over,
for example, resource limits in some implementations but the idea is
to create as close a copy as possible).
</p>

<p>
The new process (child) gets a different process ID (PID) and has the
the PID of the old process (parent) as its parent PID (PPID). Because
the two processes are now running exactly the same code, they can tell
which is which by the return code of fork - the child gets 0, the
parent gets the PID of the child. This is all, of course, assuming the
fork call works - if not, no child is created and the parent gets an
error code.
</p>

<p>
Exec : The exec call is a way to basically replace the entire current
process with a new program. It loads the program into the current
process space and runs it from the entry point. exec() replaces the
current process with a the executable pointed by the function. Control
never returns to the original program unless there is an exec() error.

A process contains two kinds of information: resources that are
available to the entire process such as program instructions, global

program counters and stacks. A thread is an entity within a process
that consists of the schedulable part of the process.

</div><div id="outline-container-sec-45-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-45-1">The Theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-45-1">
<p>
In theory, when a thread tries to lock a mutex and it does not
succeed, because the mutex is already locked, it will go to sleep,
immediately allowing another thread to run. It will continue to sleep
until being woken up, which will be the case once the mutex is being
unlocked by whatever thread was holding the lock before. When a thread
tries to lock a spinlock and it does not succeed, it will continuously
re-try locking it, until it finally succeeds; thus it will not allow
another thread to take its place (however, the operating system will
forcefully switch to another thread, once the CPU runtime quantum of
the current thread has been exceeded, of course).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-45-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-45-2">The Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-45-2">
<p>
The problem with mutexes is that putting threads to sleep and waking
them up again are both rather expensive operations, they'll need quite
a lot of CPU instructions and thus also take some time. If now the
mutex was only locked for a very short amount of time, the time spent
in putting a thread to sleep and waking it up again might exceed the
time the thread has actually slept by far and it might even exceed the
time the thread would have wasted by constantly polling on a spinlock.
On the other hand, polling on a spinlock will constantly waste CPU
time and if the lock is held for a longer amount of time, this will
waste a lot more CPU time and it would have been much better if the
thread was sleeping instead.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-45-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-45-3">The Solution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-45-3">
<p>
Using spinlocks on a single-core/single-CPU system makes usually no
sense, since as long as the spinlock polling is blocking the only
available CPU core, no other thread can run and since no other thread
can run, the lock won't be unlocked either. IOW, a spinlock wastes
only CPU time on those systems for no real benefit. If the thread was
put to sleep instead, another thread could have ran at once, possibly
unlocking the lock and then allowing the first thread to continue
processing, once it woke up again.
</p>

<p>
On a multi-core/multi-CPU systems, with plenty of locks that are held
for a very short amount of time only, the time wasted for constantly
putting threads to sleep and waking them up again might decrease
runtime performance noticeably. When using spinlocks instead, threads
get the chance to take advantage of their full runtime quantum (always
only blocking for a very short time period, but then immediately
continue their work), leading to much higher processing throughput.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-45-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-45-4">The Practice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-45-4">
<p>
Since very often programmers cannot know in advance if mutexes or
spinlocks will be better (e.g. because the number of CPU cores of the
target architecture is unknown), nor can operating systems know if a
certain piece of code has been optimized for single-core or multi-core
environments, most systems don't strictly distinguish between mutexes
and spinlocks. In fact, most modern operating systems have hybrid
mutexes and hybrid spinlocks. What does that actually mean?
</p>

<p>
A hybrid mutex behaves like a spinlock at first on a multi-core
system. If a thread cannot lock the mutex, it won't be put to sleep
immediately, since the mutex might get unlocked pretty soon, so
instead the mutex will first behave exactly like a spinlock. Only if
the lock has still not been obtained after a certain amount of time
(or retries or any other measuring factor), the thread is really put
to sleep. If the same system runs on a system with only a single core,
the mutex will not spinlock, though, as, see above, that would not be
beneficial.
</p>

<p>
A hybrid spinlock behaves like a normal spinlock at first, but to
avoid wasting too much CPU time, it may have a back-off strategy. It
will usually not put the thread to sleep (since you don't want that to
happen when using a spinlock), but it may decide to stop the thread
(either immediately or after a certain amount of time) and allow
another thread to run, thus increasing chances that the spinlock is
unlocked (a pure thread switch is usually less expensive than one that
involves putting a thread to sleep and waking it up again later on,
though not by far).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-45-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-45-5">Summary</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-45-5">
<p>
If in doubt, use mutexes, they are usually the better choice and most
modern systems will allow them to spinlock for a very short amount of
time, if this seems beneficial. Using spinlocks can sometimes improve
performance, but only under certain conditions and the fact that you
are in doubt rather tells me, that you are not working on any project
currently where a spinlock might be beneficial. You might consider
using your own "lock object", that can either use a spinlock or a
mutex internally (e.g. this behavior could be configurable when
creating such an object), initially use mutexes everywhere and if you
think that using a spinlock somewhere might really help, give it a try
and compare the results (e.g. using a profiler), but be sure to test
both cases, a single-core and a multi-core system before you jump to
conclusions (and possibly different operating systems, if your code
will be cross-platform).
</p>

<p>
Spin-locks are best used when a piece of code cannot go to sleep
state. Best example of such code would be interrupts request handlers.
</p>

<p>
Mutexes are best used in user space program where sleeping of process
does not affect the system in catastrophic way.
